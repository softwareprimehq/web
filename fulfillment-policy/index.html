                Fulfillment Policy for Stripe Payments</h1>

            <p>These policies will help users understand how Trioangle Technologies processes orders and payments
                through Stripe. </p>
            <p>This Fulfillment Policy (the "Policy") governs your use of the services and website provided by Trioangle
                Technologies ("Trioangle," "we," or "us") via <a href="../index.html"
                    style="text-transform: lowercase;">trioangle.com</a> (the "Website") with payment processor Stripe.
                By accessing or using the Website and the services offered through it, you ("User" or "you") agree to be
                bound by this Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please refrain from using the Website.</p>
            <p>Trioangle offers a refund policy and service delivery procedures as terms stated below.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;" class="mb-3">1. Access & User Information</h4>
            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Account Registration & Data Collection</h3>

            <p>To purchase services or request a consultation, you may be required to complete a contact or registration
                form by providing accurate personal and/or business information. You agree to update such information as
                needed and to notify Trioangle immediately of any unauthorized use or security breach related to your
                account credentials collected in Stripe.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Eligibility & Use</h3>

            <p>By using the Website, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age (if an individual) or are legally
                empowered to enter into agreements on behalf of your organization. Website use is available only to
                those legally permitted to access and use our services. </p>
            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Usage Restrictions</h3>

            <p>Trioangle reserves the right to limit, suspend, or terminate your access to the Website or specific
                services at its sole discretion, without prior notice.</p>


            <h4 style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;">2. Modifications to This Policy</h4>

            <p>Trioangle reserves the right to modify, update, or amend this Policy—including changes to fees, charges,
                service delivery terms, or refund conditions—at any time. It is your responsibility to review this
                Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Website after any modifications constitutes your
                acceptance of the updated terms.</p>



            <h4 style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;" class="mb-3">3. Order Processing and Service Fulfillment</h4>
            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Order Acceptance</h3>
            <p>All service requests, proposals, or project inquiries submitted through the Website require approval from
                Trioangle. We reserve the right to accept or decline any order at our discretion. Upon acceptance, you
                will receive a confirmation detailing the scope, timeline, and pricing of the requested service.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Product Delivery & Service Fulfillment</h3>
            <p>Our products align with the agreed-upon specifications outlined in written communication (such as email,
                proposals, or formal contracts). This may encompass digital assets, scheduled advisory sessions, or
                in-person engagements as needed. While estimated timelines are shared for organizational purposes,
                actual delivery may be influenced by project intricacies or unforeseen circumstances.</p>

            <p>Services are delivered based on the specifications agreed upon in writing (via email, proposal, or formal
                contract). This may include digital deliverables, scheduled consultations, or on-site visits, as
                applicable. Estimated delivery times are provided for planning purposes only and may vary due to project
                complexity or external factors.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Milestones & Updates</h3>
            <p>For projects spanning multiple phases or milestones, Trioangle will communicate progress updates and may
                require additional approvals before proceeding to subsequent stages.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;" class="mb-3">4. Payments and Fees</h4>

            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Payment Information & Storage</h3>
            <p>When you purchase services, you may be redirected to Stripe for quick payment processing where you can
                enter the necessary details. Unless you notify us otherwise via email at sales@trioangle.com, we may
                securely store your payment information for future transactions.</p>
            <p>We process payments through bank transfer, and PayPal also. When you make a payment using these methods,
                they collect and process your payment details (e.g., bank account details, address) by their respective
                Privacy Policies and Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>Trioangle does not store sensitive payment data such as account numbers directly. </p>
            <p>For more details about payment processing, refunds, and other related terms, please read our <a
                    href="../privacy-policy/index.html" style="font-weight:bold;" target="_blank"> Privacy
                    Policy.</a></p>

            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Authorization</h3>
            <p>By accepting this Policy, you confirm that you are legally entitled to use the provided payment method.
            </p>

            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Currency & Responsibility</h3>
            <p>Unless otherwise specified, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for all fees,
                payments, and applicable taxes associated with the Website and its services.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;" class="mb-3">5. Online Payment Security</h4>

            <p>Trioangle employs secure payment gateways like Stripe for processing all online transactions. All credit
                card and payment information collected via the Stripe payment gateway is encrypted using a 128-bit SSL
                certificate and is never visible to us or any third party. All transaction data is stored in bank-grade
                data centers, ensuring that your sensitive payment information remains protected.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Stripe Payment Fulfillment</h3>


            <p>All credit card payments made on our Website are processed by Stripe, a secure third-party payment
                processor. </p>

            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Processing & Storage: Your complete credit card details are handled
                    exclusively by Stripe, and Trioangle does not have access to your full card information.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Stripe's Terms: Transactions are processed by Stripe’s security

                    security of your credit card information, please contact Stripe or our support team at <a

            <h4 style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;" class="mb-3">6. Refund Policy</h4>
            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Eligibility for Refunds</h3>
            <p>Trioangle provides digital products that are intangible and non-refundable. As a result, once an order is

            </p>
            <h4 style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;" class="mb-3">7. Return Policy</h4>

            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Applicability</h3>
            <p>Since our services are digital and customized to meet your project requirements, traditional physical
                returns do not apply. In the context of our services, a "return" refers to a request for corrections if
                the delivered service does not meet agreed specifications.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Procedure for Returns</h3>
            <p>If you believe the delivered service does not conform to the agreed scope or quality, please contact us
                immediately at <a class="d-inline-block text-lowercase" href="mailto:sales@trioangle.com">
                    sales@trioangle.com </a> with detailed information regarding your concerns. We will review your
                claim and, if warranted, may offer service corrections, re-performance, or, if appropriate, a partial or
                full refund in line with our Refund Policy.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Timeframe</h3>
            <p>Requests related to service returns must be submitted within the applicable refund request period as
                outlined in Section 6.</p>
            <h4 style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;" class="mb-3">8. Order Cancellation and Modifications</h4>

            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Cancellation by User</h3>
            <p>You may cancel your service request by contacting us at <a class="d-inline-block text-lowercase"
                    href="mailto:sales@trioangle.com"> sales@trioangle.com </a>. Cancellations must be received before
                service delivery begins. If a cancellation request is received after work has commenced, Trioangle may
                retain payment for services rendered up to that point and may charge an administrative fee. If a request
                is made before delivery, it may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, subject to administrative and
                processing fees. Custom development or integration services are non-cancelable once initiated. </p>

            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <p>Trioangle Technologies understands that plans can change, and you may need to cancel your service.</p>

            <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If a client wishes to cancel a project at any stage, Trioangle
                    Technologies requires a written cancellation request with an authorized signature.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If a project is canceled before completion, an invoice will be issued
                    for the work completed up to that point, based on the resources utilized.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If there is a delay from the client’s side exceeding 30 days, the
                    project will be considered canceled. </li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">To restart the project, a written request must be submitted. In such
                    cases, an invoice will be generated for the work completed, reflecting the resources used</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Modifications to Orders</h3>
            <p>If you need to modify an existing order or service request, please notify us promptly. While we will make
                every effort to accommodate changes, modifications may affect pricing and delivery timelines and will be
                confirmed in writing.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;" class="mb-3">9. Stripe Payment Disputes</h4>

            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>In the event of a stripe payment dispute, you agree to work with Trioangle in good faith to resolve the
                issue. If a resolution cannot be reached, the matter may be subject to the dispute resolution process
                outlined in <strong>Section 11 </strong> below. </p>
            <h4 style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;" class="mb-3">10. General Terms and Limitations</h4>

            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">No Agency or Partnership</h3>
            <p>This Policy does not create an agency, partnership, or employee-employer relationship between you and
                Trioangle. All rights and obligations under this Policy remain solely with each party. If any part of
                this Policy is found to be invalid, the remaining provisions will still apply. </p>

            <h3 style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;">Data Collection</h3>
