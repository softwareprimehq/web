                    <p class="fw-bold">How they accomplished this victory?</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">Let’s listen to the golden utterances of Mohammed Ali, that he shared during his
                        visit to Trioangle’s HQ.</p>
                    <p>Feeling great talking to the team which helped me when I was aiming about taking the business
                        online.
                    </p>
                    <p>Literally, four years ago, I was at the age of 28 with an idea for a rental business in Tunis. I
                        was, to confess, feeling anxious about the inherent risks of starting a business. But I have
                        fully immersed myself in the process of bringing my idea to life.</p>
                    <p>I have to say that my journey was filled with endurance and challenges. Especially in the
                        financial realm, I faced numerous difficulties. However, my fortunes changed when I met with a
                        friend who shared my passion for investing in promising ventures. With his valuable and timely
                        contributions, we forged a dynamic partnership that propelled our business to new heights of
                        success.</p>
                    <p>As a fledgling business, we encountered several burdens, with our biggest challenge being the
                        task of reaching out to potential customers. To tackle this, we devised a solution by launching
                        a rental website to serve as a platform for connecting with our target audience. However, we
                        didn't stop there - we set our sights on creating a world-class website to expand our reach to
                        customers worldwide.</p>
                    <p>With a strong commitment to excellence, we conducted extensive research to identify the most
                        suitable website development team to bring our vision to life. After much deliberation, we
                        identified Trioangle Technologies as the ideal partner to help us achieve our goals. In November
                        2018, we initiated discussions with Trioangle via email, sharing our business vision and
                        intentions for the website development process.</p>
                    <p>Our first point of contact with Trioangle Technologies was Mr. Ajith Kumar, the Vice President of
                        Services, who impressed us with his keen understanding of our business vision right from the
                        initial discussion. Throughout the project, Mr. Ajith Kumar and his team provided unwavering
                        support, making themselves available at all times to address any issues that arose. Their
                        exemplary cooperation and dedication were instrumental in ensuring the success of our
                        collaboration.</p>
                    <p>At the outset of our collaboration with Trioangle Technologies, we encountered a technical issue
                        with Google Map integration, which threatened to derail our plans. However, the talented
                        professionals there quickly sprang into action and solved that issue shortly, which I’m feeling
                        proud about Trioangle. And it’s my duty to appreciate their dedicated website development
                        process, which encompassed a wide range of tasks, including:</p>
                    <ul class="default-list-style ps-3">
                        <li>Consistent communication,</li>
                        <li>Business trend analysis,</li>
                        <li>UX/UI design configurations, </li>
                        <li>Key features integrations, etc.</li>
                        <li>Good relation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thanks to Trioangle’s innovative approach to lead generation and brand awareness campaigns, and
                        helped us achieve a significant impact in terms of our business growth. Throughout our 4+ year
                        journey with them, we were impressed by their determined commitment to our cause and their
                        tireless efforts in building and promoting our website within the Tunisian market. Their
                        contributions have been supplemental to our success, and we look forward to continuing our
                        partnership with them in the future also.</p>
                    <p>Our collaboration with Trioangle Technologies has been nothing short of exceptional, and we are
                        delighted to award them a 4.2-star rating out of 5 for their outstanding work. Before teaming up
                        with Trioangle, our bookings were at a minimum of 5, but their expert guidance and support
                        helped us achieve our goals and surpass our expectations.</p>
                    <p>To analyze the growth, we framed some goals before tying up with Trioangle. They are:</p>
                    <ul class="default-list-style ps-3">
                        <li>To get more revenue via more bookings</li>
                        <li>Launch a web application</li>
                        <li>Expanding the business to an international region</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the last year alone, we have achieved an incredible milestone of over 6000 bookings. This
                        transformational growth has been a testament of Trioangle’s contribution. Without their
                        technical assistance, the goals might not come to life. For sure, we are thrilled with the
                        results.</p>
                    <p>As we continue to build on our success, our next goal is to expand TunRooms into new
                        international markets, with a particular focus on North Africa, including Morocco, as well as
                        Dubai, Kuwait, and beyond.</p>
                    <p>We are excited about the opportunities ahead and are confident that with the continued support of
                        our partners at Trioangle Technologies, we will achieve even greater heights in the years to
                        come.</p>

                    <p class="fw-bold">About GrubUp</p>
                    <p>GrubUp is an online food marketplace in Australia, founded by Asfahan Ahmed in the year 2020.
                        Look on
                        the Grubup you can see a wide number of food menus, that caters to delivery to the respective
                        customers all around the city.</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">Goals And Objectives Of GrubUp</p>
                    <p>The ultimate vision of the Grubup app is to connect hungry Australians to home chefs or
                        restaurants.
                        Their mission is to furnish food delivery all over the city including long-distance, not
                        limiting it
                        to some specific kilometer via a user-friendly mobile app.</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">GrubUp’s Owner Zeal To Design A Mobile App</p>
                    <p>When Ahmed sparked a unique business proposal, people processed the food deliveries through phone
                        calls with certain restaurants, and with no explored food items located at long distances. So,
                        Ahmed
                        planned to tune over this efficient food delivery process into a smart mobile app platform.</p>
                    <p>But he toiled more in researching to pick renowned app development providers.</p>
                    <p>Yes, we asked Grubup owner Mr. Ahmed about the hurdles to launching a mobile app, and about his
                        notion of finding mobile app providers.</p>
                    <p>He replied,</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">“It was a big hardship for me in picking the best development company, but my
                        only
                        twin condition is to capture the qualified software with low cost that compiled with quick
                        turnaround Time.”</p>
                    <p>While Ahmed fetched our Trioangle’s team to build the mobile app marketplace for food delivery.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">How Trioangle Played A Pivotal Role In Building GrubUp App?</p>
                    <p>Ahmed needed compelling food marketplace software at an affordable price, simultaneously with a
                        quick
                        launching turnaround time. As per the words from Ahmed, we people at Trioangle sturdily work to
                        build enticing food delivery software.</p>
                    <p>We analyze all his business requirements and finalize all the customization requirements accords
                        to
                        the market’s value and feature trends.</p>
                    <p>In keeping with this, Trioangle conversed with Ahmed at every stage of the development process.
                        Eventually, we complete the entire project at the right time as per Ahmed desire’s of getting
                        his
                        dream live in quick TAT.</p>
                    <p>We asked GrubUp’s owner, about his journey with Trioangle in making his dreamy venture,</p>
                    <p>He said,</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">“When I was tracking for a first-rate app builder, I found this Trioangle team,
                        who
                        supported me on my foremost entrepreneurial journey in the mobile app platform. They were the
                        first
                        team I collaborated with for app building. I’ve elaborated my business thoughts to the experts
                        in
                        Trioangle, and they examined it and worked tirelessly to bring all those customization
                        requirements
                        to a structured food delivery marketplace.</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold">Their BA and support team have assisted me with a plethora of great timely info,
                        about the project status. It nourishes me with a seamless communication experience. At the
