                <h3 style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;">
                        Last Updated: Mar 17, 2025
                </h3>
                <p>
                        By making a payment for purchasing the product/customization project you acknowledge and agree to this policy. At Trioangle Minds Technologies Pvt Ltd, we offer digital, non-returnable, and non-tangible irrevocable goods, which means that all sales are final. As the source code is the primary and ultimate deliverable in a software purchase, refunds cannot be issued once the source code (without customization) has been delivered via email with a download link or the product has been deployed (installed/submitted).

                </p>
                <p>
                        We provide fully functional demos of our products. The client may test both the user web & mobile apps, and admin panel or request a demo call before making a purchase. It is the sole responsibility of the client to review the product functionalities, add-ons, support packages, and policies before purchasing. Placing an order signifies that the product aligns with your requirements & you agree to our Terms & Conditions and Refund Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                        All our products are delivered as per commitment and will function exactly as demonstrated. Issue may occur due to client-side environments (e.g., browser settings, internet connection, hosting/server architecture). Any such issues are covered under our support policy. For more details, please refer to the <a href="../support/index.html" target="_blank">support policy</a>, as these do not qualify for refunds.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Refunds will not be applicable under certain circumstances, as outlined below. Once a purchase is made, it is considered final, and refunds cannot be issued for changes in preference, such as deciding not to use the product or opting for a different theme or script after completing the purchase. Additionally, if the product functions as advertised in the demo and documentation, but does not meet individual expectations, it does not qualify for a refund.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Clients are responsible for ensuring compliance with their local laws and regulations before purchasing, as legal or policy restrictions in their country do not qualify for a refund. While we adhere to industry-standard security practices, technology constantly evolves, and no software is entirely immune to evolving vulnerabilities. Therefore, refunds will not be provided in cases related to security breaches. Similarly, as our products are designed to deliver functional outcomes, refund requests based on subjective assessments of code quality will not be entertained. If the client is interested in looking into the code, we will share some code samples before making the purchase. While our team follows best practices and platform guidelines to ensure successful app submissions, approval by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store is solely at the discretion of these platforms. If an app is not approved due to policy restrictions, business model conflicts, or other reasons beyond our control, it will not be eligible for a refund. However, we are happy to provide guidance and necessary modifications, if feasible, to improve the chances of approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                        For a Customization/Service project, In making a payment (full/deposit) to initiate the project, resources and manpower are allocated to ensure seamless execution. As development progresses, full refunds become impractical once the project has commenced. If a client chooses to discontinue the project midway, an adjustment may be made on a case-by-case basis to account for unutilized manpower/resource hours. For the project discontinued midway, the client is entitled to receive the completed work corresponding to the payments made up to that point if the as-is product’s cost is paid in full. The scope of deliverables will be determined based on the progress of the project at the time of discontinuation and the agreed-upon payment terms. For third-party integrations, while our team makes every effort to complete the requested implementation, external factors such as API limitations, third-party service restrictions, or environmental dependencies may sometimes impact timelines. Any delays arising from such external factors will not be eligible for a refund. However, in cases where unforeseen delays occur without external influence, we are committed to working collaboratively with the client to establish a revised timeline and ensure successful project completion. Our focus remains on delivering a high-quality solution within the best possible timeframe. Furthermore, as each project is carefully planned and executed based on client-approved Task Breakdown Document—which is reviewed and confirmed before development begins—refund requests after final delivery will not be applicable. We encourage clients to communicate any requirements or concerns beforehand to ensure a smooth and satisfactory development experience.
